## Key Technical Notes

1. **Physics System**: Both arcade and realistic physics fully editable in Unity Inspector via `PhysicsConfig` ScriptableObject
2. **Scoring Logic**: Exact port from web version ensures identical gameplay
3. **Multi-Platform**: Configured for WebGL, iOS, Android, and PC from the start
4. **UI Toolkit**: Modern, performance-focused UI system with CSS-like styling
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Manager classes use C# events for loose coupling
6. **Singleton Pattern**: Core managers (GameManager, AudioManager, etc.) use singleton pattern

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining manager classes (TurnManager, RoundManager, BallSpawner)
2. Create basic UI structure with UI Toolkit
3. Set up GameScene with 3D table and balls
4. Implement ball selection and shooting mechanics
5. Add audio system
6. Implement statistics tracking
7. Add visual polish and effects
8. Optimize and deploy
